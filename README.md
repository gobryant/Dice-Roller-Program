# Dice-Roller-Program
A straightforward dice-rolling program that could be implemented in other programs.

Includes the following:
  1. asks the number of dice desired to roll
  2. asks the number of sides each die has
  3. Displays each value

Slowed version adds additional time to "roll the dice," and staggers the display of each roll
